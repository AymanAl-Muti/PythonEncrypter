# PythonEncrypter
Takes username and password inputs and then encrypts them. Then they are put into a csv file, with time of creation, a username, an encrypted password. Then once you try to create another account it checks if the username already exists within the csv file. **Will be moved into an SQL database soon AND GUI**
